# FaceLogin
Face Recognition Web App This project is a web-based facial recognition application built with Flask, Keras, and OpenCV. The app captures images from a user's webcam, detects faces using Haar Cascades, and then authenticates users based on the similarity between the captured face and a stored reference using a pre-trained Siamese neural network.
